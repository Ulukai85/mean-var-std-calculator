This is a project I worked on for claiming the Data Analysis-Certificate. Instructions for building this project can be found here: [project specifications](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/mean-variance-standard-deviation-calculator)

I wrote the code for [mean_var_std.py](https://github.com/Ulukai85/mean-var-std-calculator/blob/main/mean_var_std.py).
I tried to be pretty concise and implemented a dictionary with the statistical functions to effectively loop through the demanded functions.
